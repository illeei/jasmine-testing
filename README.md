## Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Project #4
# Project Overview

In this project we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.The project is to write tests to analyze each part of this application and make sure it runs smoothly.

## What I learned

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application to test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## How to run the tests

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Load index.html5
3. Scroll to the bottom to see test results

The spec file for this Jasmine test can be found under the folder jasmine > spec > feedreader.js

## About this project:

The tests are made with [Jasmine](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md). Full documentation can be found [here](https://jasmine.github.io/).
